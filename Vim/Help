if you want to check the documentation or help
type :help or :h <name of what you want to read>
Ex: :help linewise, :h linewise

If you don't want to type, just put the cursor under the word and type:
ctrl + ]

In the dox, the words inside the opening and closing brackets are optional.
Ex: :q[uit], you can type :q or :quit

You can go to your file and edit while the help window is open. Just type:
ctrl + w + w


Let's say you want to look at the documentation for a command,
but you're not quite sure what the entire command is in this situation.
You can use command-line completion

type :h followed by the start of the command you're looking for and then type control D.

Ex: :h :q + ctrl d

You can also :h :q + tab
